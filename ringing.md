## Stora Karlsö

In the summer of 2025 I joined the **Baltic Seabird Project** research team in Stora Karlsö to help them with the guillemot ringing season. 
Here I aided team with guillemot ringing, chick monitoring, data entry, as well as eider and razorbill surveys.
Additionally, I got the opportunity to assist with maintenance of the artificial cliffside (Auk Lab), including the upkeep of monitoring cameras.

## Ottenby
In the summer and autumn season of 2025 I worked as a **Ringing Assistant** at **Ottenby Bird Observatory (BirdLife)**. In this role my main responsibility included assisting in standardised ringing at Ottenby Fågelstation during the standardised trapping season.
Through this I aided with trapping and extracting birds from mist nets, Heligoland traps and wader cages. Additionally, during my period at Ottenby, I aided with waterfowl sampling (Blood, oropharyngeal and cloacal).
Alongside ringing, additional tasks included data entry, guided tours (in both English and Swedish), and additional practical conservation tasks, such as trap and vegetation maintenance.

Alongside the practical work, I also spent time working in the Naturum Museum and the Naturbutiken gift shop.

## Landsort

During the autumn season in 2025, I also had the opportunity to assist with ringing at Landsort Bird Observatory. 

## Upplands Ornitologiska Förening

Throoughout 2025 and 2026, I have been working alongside **Upplands Ornithological Association** to set up a Constant Effort Site (CES) in Uppsala to promote ringing and birding to the public.
Through this role, I am learning about the process of setting up a ringing station, including practical tasks and communication with the local community and land owners. 
Additionally, trough this role, I am responsible for helping to educate and communicate the role of UOF in Uppsala and to assist with bird ringing around various locations in Uppland.
