# Sara Marolt

*Marine ecologist specializing in hydroacoustic methods, pelagic fish distribution, and seabird–prey interactions.*

## Research Focus

I study how seabirds interact with pelagic fish and how these mid-trophic species influence marine ecosystems. My work combines **hydroacoustics**, **spatial modeling in R**, and behavioral ecology.

### Key Areas:
- **Hydroacoustics** – analyzing pelagic fish distributions from echosounder data  
- **Diel vertical migration** – understanding fish movements and predator-prey dynamics  
- **Seabird–prey interactions** – linking predator behavior to mid-trophic dynamics  
- **Spatial modelling in R** – mapping fish and seabird distributions

## Current Work

Currently investigating the **vertical and horizontal distribution of pelagic fish near Stora Karlsö**, linking fish behavior to seabird foraging patterns.
