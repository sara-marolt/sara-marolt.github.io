I'm **Sara**, an Ecology and Conservation Master's student at Uppsala University. I am currently working under the supervision of Jonas Hentati Sundberg with the Baltic Seabird Project at the Swedish Agricultural University. 

My current thesis project, *Seabird mediated spatiotemporal distriution of pelagic fish in the Baltic Sea*, is focused on modelling the horizontal and vertical distribution of pelagic fish in proximity to a guillemot colony using echosounder derived data. 

Prior to starting my Masters, I completed my **BSc (Hons) in Biology** at the University of St. Andrews, where my thesis looked at the *Effect of anthropogenic disturbances on the escape behaviour in Eurasian Oystercatchers*
