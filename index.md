title: About Me
---


I'm **Sara**, an Ecology and Conservation Master's student at Uppsala University. My current thesis project, completed under the Baltic Seabird Project, is focused on modelling the spatiotemporal distribution of pelagic fish in proximity to a guillemot colony.

## Research Focus

I main research focus centres around how seabirds interact with pelagic fish and how these mid-trophic species influence marine ecosystems. My work combines **hydroacoustics**, **spatial modeling in R**, and behavioral ecology.

### Key Areas:
- **Hydroacoustics** – analyzing pelagic fish distributions from echosounder data  
- **Diel vertical migration** – understanding fish movements and predator-prey dynamics  
- **Seabird–prey interactions** – linking predator behavior to mid-trophic dynamics  
- **Spatial modelling in R** – mapping fish distributions
